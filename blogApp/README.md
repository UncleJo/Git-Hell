# Mysite Info
Well, that's my first project in django which is a basic blogging system/webapp that can register different user set their profile information and post and see other people's blogs.

# Licence

I don't know what the appropriate licensing for this project is, so until I decide, the licence is this: Be cool. Check out my code, play with it, perhaps even improve it! If you're going to sell it or use it to make money, ask first, and we'll work that out. If it's being given away, maintain proper attribution.

I'll probably just GPL it, along with whatever other inconsequential repos I have available to the public, but not just yet.
