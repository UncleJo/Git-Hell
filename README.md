# Git-Hell
All the small scrips of code to big functions to use, all in one place. Wrote a stupid code which is not in use, put it here.
New beginnings are exciting, but difficult & fragile times. This set of scrips is intended to make those times go much easier than they otherwise might.

The intended target system is mainly Linux, but though much of this will work on other platforms without modifcation (Terms and conditions apply).
